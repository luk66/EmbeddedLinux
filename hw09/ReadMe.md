*2.6 Blinking an LED
  This part was captured in Blinking_an_LED.png
  I got frequency at 12.5MHz. There jitter. It is quite stable.
*5.3 PWM Generator
  This part was captured in PWM_Genrator.png
  I got frequency at 40MHz. The Std Dev is 10MHz.There is little jitter.
*5.4 Controlling the PWM Frequency
  This part was captured in Controlling_PWM.png
  The highest freq here is 326.9KHz. There is little jitter.
*5.5 Loop Unrolling for Better Performance
  This part was captured in Loop_Unrolling.png
  The highest frequency here is 1.682MHz. We have a 5X speedup.
*5.9 Reading an Input at Regular Intervals
  This part was captured in Reading_Input.png
  The upper one is the input from function generator; the lower one is the output from pin.
  Transfer can be done in 64ns.
