1. Where does Julia Cartwright work?
  Julia works at National Instruments.

2. What is PREEMPT_RT?
  It is a real-time kernel patch.

3. What is mixed criticality?
  Mixed criticality is the systems that might run two different types of tasks, such as real-time required tasks and non-real-time required tasks.

4.	How can drivers misbehave? 
  Because the driver stacks are shared between the RT tasks and non-RT tasks.

5.	What is Î” in Figure 1?
  Delta is the latency, the time it takes from a event to occur until the relevant real-time tasks execute.

6.	What is Cyclictest[2]?
  Cyclictest can accurately and repeatedly measures the differece between a thread's instended wakeup time and the time at which it actually wakes up in order to provide statistics about the system's latencies.

7.	What is plotted in Figure 2?
  Figure2 plots the preempt and preempt_rt latencies histogram.

8.	What is dispatch latency?  Scheduling latency?
  Dispatch latency is the amount of time that from hardware firing to interupt patch occuring and the relevant threads being told to woken up to run.
  Scheduling latency is amount of time that from it awares that tasks needed to be run to the tasks being actually scheduled to execute on CPU.

9.	What is mainline?
  Mainline models the timeline that threads being executed.

10.	What is keeping the External event in Figure 3 from starting?
  Longest running interrupt handler.

11.	Why can the External event in Figure 4 start sooner?
  Because it reduces the irq dispatch latency by letting higher priority tasks running on threads immediately.
